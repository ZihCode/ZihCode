#### Hey Bro ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is ***Zykee Lu***,and I currently live in **Shenzhen,China** and I come from **Northeast China**.

I write projects about audio algorthms in github.

- I graduated from ***Communication University of China(CUC) last year(2022)***,majoring in Broadcasting and Television Engineering.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Guitar Audio Algorithm(Enya Music):
- &emsp;&emsp;~~PitchShifting Algorithm.(Time domain scheme and frequency domain scheme) In Pure C.~~  Finished!âœŒ(Almost)&emsp;2023/6/5

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning FT(Fourier); Artificial Intelligence; Music algorithm and so on.At the same time, I am strengthening my cpp skills by learning the content posted on learncpp.com, and I hope to finish this part of learning by March next year.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with dsp algorithm.Like Wavelet transform, STFT, HHT(Hilbert-Huang Transform), Filters and so on.I sometimes go to the CCRMA Institute on MIT's website to learn about modern signal processing.

- ðŸ’¬ Some development experience of the project I have completed can be found on my personal WeChat official account: YiyinValley_

- âš¡ Fun fact: 
-  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Interested in Music: &nbsp; *RockNRoll*    , &nbsp; *HipHop*    
-  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I hope to establish a better connection between creation and humanityï¼Œactually I am an idealist.Often write some of my own mood or lyrics, another is an electric guitar player.  
-  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Novice to DSP audio algorithms, hoping to find people with similar interests to improve together.
