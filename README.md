#### Hey Bro ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is ***Zykee Lu***,and I currently live in **Shenzhen,China** and I come from **Northeast China**.

I write projects about audio algorthms in github.

- I graduated from ***Communication University of China(CUC) last year(2022)***,majoring in Broadcasting and Television Engineering.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning FT(Fourier); Artificial Intelligence; Music algorithm and so on.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with dsp algorithm.Like Wavelet transform, STFT, HHT(Hilbert-Huang Transform) and so on.

- ðŸ’¬ Some development experience of the project I have completed can be found on my personal WeChat official account: YiyinValley_

- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;WeChat:  **GhettoArtistZykee**
  
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;QQ:   **2720229295**

  
- âš¡ Fun fact: 
-  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Interested in Music: &nbsp; *RockNRoll*    , &nbsp; *HipHop*    
-  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I hope to establish a better connection between creation and humanityï¼Œactually I am an idealist.
-  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Novice to DSP audio algorithms, hoping to find people with similar interests to improve together.
