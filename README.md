My name is ***Zykee Lu***,and I currently live in **Shenzhen** and come from **Northeast China**.

- I graduated from ***Communication University of China(CUC) last year(2022)***,majoring in Broadcasting and Television Engineering.
  ************************************************************************************************************************************

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Guitar Audio Algorithm(Enya Music):
- &emsp;&emsp;~~PitchShifting Algorithm.(Time domain scheme and frequency domain scheme)~~  Finished!(Almost)
- &emsp;&emsp;~~Electric guitar cranking algorithm. (real-time modulation algorithm but to ensure polyphony)~~  Finished!(Almost)
- &emsp;&emsp;PitchShifting using classic phase vocoder(PV)(Currently)
- &emsp;&emsp;~~FAST CONVOLUTION Algorithm.~~ Finished!(Almost)
- &emsp;&emsp;Whistling suppression algorithm(Currently)

************************************************************************************************************************************

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning FT(Fourier); Artificial Intelligence; Music algorithm and so on.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with dsp algorithm.

- ðŸ’¬ Some development experience of the project I have completed can be found on my personal WeChat official account: YiyinValley_
